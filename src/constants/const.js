      `___Remove Negativity__

            Stop hanging out with the people who drain your energy, you don't like your success,
            Surround yourself with people who put your energy up
            Nobody can say something to you that offends you that you believe is true about you.
            So it's a gift, they are showing you you are not fulfilled so start.`,

      `You get a trigger then you know here I need to work.
            Confidence not only comes from achievement, it also comes from things they don't want to do and they do it at least, and that thing is good for them.
            Take advice from people who don't know anything about that thing.`,

      `..............._Confidance_.................
            Take.some.fotm of action.
            Impostar syndrom - I can't do this and that.
            Start calling yourself beginner and not imposter.

            So start to show yourself up. 

            Do those things more,
            Compliance - I can do it better.

            Then you gain confidence.`,

      `Practice -
            1. Deliver Practice
            It's about focus and consistency doing focus work.
            Figure out the area you want to get better, break down this and focus on one step at a time and keep doing it consistently. You'll gain compliance and hence confidance.
            Keep remind yourself you are improving.
            `,

      `2. Visualization.
            Visualizer becoming that thing.
            You train your brain to believe that thing is coming near you.
            Mess up and become more better then yourself.
            It's okay if you don't know your purpose of life, but it's not okay to waking up everyday and not find what it is.
